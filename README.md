Welcome to our application !

Our goal is to provide an efficient way for our users to search for internships. For example, a user who has created an account or not can search for internships precizing the fields they are looking for and the place too. Once connected to our application, a user will be able to save their researches, list of interests and to import/export them, thus giving a flexible way to look for internships and share their results with some friends.
Additionnaly, teachers will be able to notify through an email service of internships that they think would be interesting for a students for example.
